# Plapokku
This tool focuses on helping individual team members quickly and consistently estimate their own story points in planning poker sessions.
Instead of directly picking a point value, users make low-effort, high-accuracy relative comparisons (“larger”, “same”, “smaller”) against already-estimated stories.
This approach reduces mental load, speeds up estimation, and improves consistency, providing value beyond what most existing planning poker tools offer.
